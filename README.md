Project group 5

The game can only be played on a android device, or an android emulator.

To play multiplayer download the game at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sonsofhesslow.games.risk (only developer can sign and generate this apk)

You can only play two players offline for the moment but up to 4 online. That shouldn't be any problem and it will be changed in the future if we procced with this project.

The game is supported by all android devices acording to google play but we have just tested the application for a selected few. If there is any problem or you have a question contact frelinde@student.chalmers.se and we will try to fix the problem or answer the question at hand.
